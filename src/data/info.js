    `<p>In Missouri, expungement is the legal process in which records relating to a particular crime are sealed from state government records by court order. However, there are certain exceptions that allow expunged records to be accessed by certain parties, e.g. applying for a nursing license.</p>
     <p>Expungement does not result in the record being erased or destroyed. Expungement does not remove any mention of the criminal record from the public, e.g. a news article mentioning an arrest would not be changed. </p>
