    ### How to edit content on this page!
    There are config files that have all the content in them. 
    - src/data/info.js - This is the all of the content for the homepage/info page. 
    - src/data/termsOfUse.js - This is all of the content for the terms section of the application. 
    - src/data/waiver.js - This is all of the content for the release and waiver section of the application. 

    Once you go to one of these files, each section is in the same order as they are on page. Headers and body texts are labeled. All content seen on the page are contained in either single or double quotes. Change anything within the quotation marks. 

    To edit a file in github, you'll need an acount first and have someone give you editing permissions. Once that is done, go to the file you want, and in the upper left hand corner, you'll see a pencil icon in between a tv icon and a trash can icon. that will allow you to edit. Once you are done editing, scroll down to the bottom of the page and you'll see a commit changes section. There is a default title for your save, or you can add a new title and add a description of what changes you made to the file. After that, skip over the two radio buttons and click the "Commit changes" button. 

    You're done! Wait a few minutes for changes to take effect and you'll see it on the website!.
